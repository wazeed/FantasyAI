# Project Brief: FantasyAI

## 1. Project Goal

To create an engaging mobile application where users can interact and chat with a diverse range of AI-powered characters (fantasy, historical, fictional, etc.).

## 2. Core Features

- User authentication (likely email/password, Google).
- Browsing and selecting AI characters.
- Real-time chat interface with selected characters.
- User profile management.
- Settings configuration (notifications, privacy, etc.).
- Potentially subscription/premium features.

## 3. Target Audience

Users interested in AI chat, role-playing, storytelling, and interacting with fictional or historical personas.

## 4. Key Technologies (Inferred)

- **Frontend:** React Native (based on file structure: `App.tsx`, `metro.config.js`, `ios/`, `android/`)
- **UI:** Potentially custom components, possibly using Tailwind if `tailwind.config.js` exists (need to verify).
- **Backend/DB:** Supabase (based on `supabase/schema.sql`, `utils/supabase.ts`, previous refactoring tasks mentioning Supabase).
- **Language:** TypeScript.

## 5. Scope Definition

This document serves as the foundational overview. Specific details on features, architecture, and implementation will be elaborated in other Memory Bank documents (`productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`).
