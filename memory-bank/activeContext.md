# Active Context - OpenRouter Integration Testing

## Current Status
- iOS build failing with RCT-Folly compilation errors
- Attempted solutions:
  - Deleted build directory
  - Changed to Legacy Build System in Xcode
  - Reinstalled pods
- Unable to proceed with voice/image input testing due to build issues

## Next Steps
1. Consider testing on Android as alternative
2. Try running through Expo Go for development testing
3. Investigate RCT-Folly compilation errors further
4. Check for React Native version compatibility issues

## Blockers
- iOS build failures preventing feature testing
- Need working build to verify OpenRouter integration
